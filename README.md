This project is a database system designed for a toy store, created as part of the **Database Course**. The system allows the store manager to efficiently manage data related to employees, customers, orders, toys, and machines.

## Features

- Business rules defined for entities and relationships.
- Mapping ER models to relational schemas.
- Normalization steps to ensure database optimization.

1. Each branch has a unique name, contact number, and location. Employees are associated with only one branch.
2. Machines can produce multiple toys, and each toy can be produced by multiple machines.
3. Employees are categorized by roles: supervisors, sales, marketing, etc.
4. Customers can place multiple orders, and each order may include multiple toys.
